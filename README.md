### A little about Carrot Dev
We're a busy group of coders. When we're not working on client projects or work with our parent company [VICE](http://vice.com), we're very active in the open-source community. We're always looking for smart people to join the team, which is why we created this repo. If you're the type of person who checks out a companies open-source contributions then you're probably the type of person we want on our team.

If you're curious about the stacks and technologies we use, get ready for a long list. These technologies have all been used in production in our work

- Ruby / Rails / Sinatra
- Node / Express
- Backbone / Marionette
- JS / Coffeescript / ES6
- CSS Preprocessing / Stylus
- Jade
- Go
- Obj-C / iOS / Swift
- Java / Android
- We've been [exploring](https://github.com/carrot/roots-react-playground) React + Flux

> PS. We love separating our client-side apps with our server-side API's. Lately we've been building either an Express or Go API and our preferred client-side stack is Roots, Marionette, Jade, Stylus
