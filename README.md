### A little about Carrot Dev
We're a busy group of coders. When we're not working on client projects or working with our parent company [VICE](http://vice.com), we're active in the open-source community. We're always looking for smart people to join the team, which is why we created this repo. If you're the type of person who checks out a company's open-source contributions then you're probably the type of person we want as a teammate.

If you're curious about the tools, stacks and technologies we use, get ready for a long list. These have all been used in production in our work:

- Ruby / Rails / Sinatra
- Node / Express
- Backbone / Marionette
- JS / Coffeescript / ES6
- CSS Preprocessing / Stylus
- Jade
- Go
- Obj-C / iOS / Swift
- Java / Android
- Pretty much every datastore (Mongo, Postgres, Redis, CouchDB, etc)
- We've been [exploring](https://github.com/carrot/roots-react-playground) React + Flux

> PS. We love separating our client-side apps from our server-side API's. Lately we've been building API's with Express or Go and our preferred client-side stack is Roots, Marionette, Jade, Stylus, Mongo/Postgres
